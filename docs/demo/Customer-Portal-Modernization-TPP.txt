**Project Charter Anchors**
- Project Title: Customer Portal Modernization

**Vision Statement**
To deliver a modern, intuitive customer portal that provides seamless self-service capabilities, reducing support call volume by 40% while increasing customer satisfaction scores to industry-leading levels. The new portal will establish our company as a digital-first organization that puts customer experience at the center of everything we do.

**Problem Statement**
Our current customer portal was built in 2018 and suffers from poor mobile responsiveness, outdated UI patterns, and limited self-service functionality. Customer support receives over 15,000 calls per month for issues that could be resolved through self-service. Customer satisfaction surveys consistently cite the portal as a top pain point, with only 45% of users rating their portal experience as satisfactory. Additionally, the legacy technology stack makes feature updates slow and expensive, with a 6-month average time-to-market for new capabilities.

**Project Description**
This project will redesign and rebuild the customer portal using a modern technology stack (React, Node.js, cloud-native architecture). Key deliverables include a responsive design optimized for mobile devices, enhanced account management features, integrated knowledge base with AI-powered search, real-time order tracking, self-service billing and payment management, and a personalized dashboard. The implementation follows an agile methodology with two-week sprints, continuous user feedback integration, and phased feature rollouts to minimize risk.

**Core Team**
- Jennifer Walsh, Executive Sponsor (Strategic direction, budget authority, executive stakeholder management)
- Marcus Thompson, Project Manager (Sprint planning, risk management, cross-functional coordination)

- James Morrison, Lead Developer (Technical architecture, code reviews, development standards)
- Amanda Chen, Product Owner (Backlog prioritization, acceptance criteria, stakeholder requirements)
- Robert Garcia, QA Manager (Test strategy, quality gates, release validation)
- Nina Kowalski, Change Management (Training programs, communication plan, adoption metrics)

**Objectives**
1. Launch the redesigned customer portal by October 2025
2. Achieve 85% customer satisfaction rating within 90 days of launch
3. Reduce support call volume by 40% through self-service adoption
4. Decrease average page load time to under 2 seconds

**Key Milestones**

**Assumptions**
- Budget of $1.2M has been approved and will remain available throughout the project
- API contracts with backend systems will be finalized by end of Q1
- Customer research participants will be available for usability testing sessions
- Infrastructure team will provision cloud environments within 2 weeks of request
- Third-party payment processor will support the new integration requirements
- Legal and compliance review will be completed within standard 3-week SLA

**Risks & Mitigations**
- API integration delays with legacy order management system → Begin integration work in Sprint 2 with dedicated integration team; prepare fallback manual sync option
- Low beta adoption rates → Implement incentive program for beta testers; ensure easy feedback mechanism
- Performance issues under load → Conduct load testing early; implement CDN and caching strategy from day one
- Data migration complexity → Create detailed migration runbook; conduct three practice migrations before go-live
- User resistance to new interface → Provide contextual tutorials; offer "classic view" option for 90-day transition period
- Resource conflicts with other IT initiatives → Secure dedicated team commitments; escalate conflicts to steering committee immediately

**Success Metrics**
- Customer Satisfaction: Achieve 85% CSAT score (measured via post-interaction surveys, currently 45%)
- Support Volume Reduction: 40% decrease in portal-related support calls (measured via call tracking system)
- Self-Service Adoption: 70% of eligible transactions completed via self-service (measured via analytics platform)
- Page Performance: Average page load time under 2 seconds (measured via Real User Monitoring)
- Mobile Engagement: 50% increase in mobile session duration (measured via Google Analytics)
- Task Completion: 90% task success rate for key user journeys (measured via usability testing and analytics)

**Stakeholders**
