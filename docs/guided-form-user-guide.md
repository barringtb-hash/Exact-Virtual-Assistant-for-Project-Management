# Guided Project Charter - User Guide

## What is the Guided Project Charter?

The Guided Project Charter is an AI-powered assistant that helps you create a comprehensive project charter by guiding you through each field, one at a time. Instead of facing a blank form, you'll have a conversation where the assistant asks questions, validates your answers, and builds your charter step-by-step.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Guided Form

1. Navigate to the Project Charter section
2. Click "Start Guided Form" or "Create with AI Assistant"
3. The assistant will greet you and explain the process

### What to Expect

- **Duration**: Approximately 15-20 minutes
- **Fields**: 15 total fields (8 required, 7 optional)
- **Format**: Conversational, one question at a time
- **Output**: Professional DOCX or PDF document

## How It Works

### The Conversation Flow

1. **Question**: The assistant asks for one field at a time
2. **Answer**: You provide your response
3. **Confirmation**: The assistant confirms what you said
4. **Next**: Move to the next field

**Example:**

```
Assistant: **Project Title** — What's the name of your project?
           (e.g., "Customer Portal Redesign 2025")

You: EMEA Ordering Modernization
